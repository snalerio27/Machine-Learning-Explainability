In real-world terms, this diagnosis is rare, but poses a larger risk for people who have it. In contrast, `payer_code_?` has many values of both blue and pink, and both have SHAP values that differ meaningfully from 0.

For example, there may be some diagnoses for which it is good to have many lab procedures, and other diagnoses where suggests increased risk.

    "Loosely speaking, num_lab_procedures looks like a cloud with little disernible pattern. It does not slope steeply up nor down at any point. It's hard to say we've learned much from that plot. At the same time, the values are not all very close to 0. So the model seems to think this is a relevant feature. One potential next step would be to explore more by coloring it with different other features to search for an interaction.\n",

    "On the other hand, num_medications clearly slopes up until a value of about 20, and then it turns back down. Without more medical background, this seems a surprising phenomenon... You could do some exploration to see whether these patients have unusual values for other features too. But a good next step would be to discuss this phenomenon with domain experts (in this case, the doctors)."
